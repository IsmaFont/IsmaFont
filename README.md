Hi, I'm ismael, I'm a 22 years old tech enthusiast from Argentina
My experience is extensive, I like to play around with tech. I worked as a sysadmin for +1 years, but I always were interested in the server-client stack, as a project I'd like to learn how to develop and deploy a full blown enterprise app backed by a complete server stack, from hardware to software, from client to server and from everything in between to anything on each side.
My related hobbies are programming (obviously), 3D modeling, 3D printing, and hosting miscelaneous apps.
